and rebuilding them should provide a full and consistent build.

.SH POSSIBLE MISBEHAVIORS

git cms-checkdeps tries to be smart and ignore changes which include a CVS
keyword. However this mean that if on the same line you change a CVS keyword
and something else, these changes will be ignored as well. This in general not
an issue, however there might be corner cases in which you might have used a
CVS keyword in some place where there is also a change actually matters on 
the same line. git cms-checkdeps will not spot those.
